# Installing the .NET Framework on Windows Vista

You may need the .NET Framework to run an application on Windows Vista. You can use the following instructions to help you. The instructions depend on which version of the .NET Framework you need.

## .NET Framework 4.6.1 and later

You cannot install the .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later on Windows Vista. Instead, you must upgrade to a later Windows version to use a later version of the .NET Framework.
